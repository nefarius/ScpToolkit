            This emergency utility can assist you in removing old traces of faild or outdated installations obstructing a
            successful fresh installation of the ScpToolkit and its drivers. If you've got troubles with the driver installer
            no one on the forums was able to help you might try this automated tool. It will try to stop, uninstall and kill
            any remains of the Windows Service, delete Virtual Bus and libusbK driver packages from the driver store and
            remove all self-signed root certificates issued by libwdi. Every system is unique, so you'll have to do this at
            your own risk!
